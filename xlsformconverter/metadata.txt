about=
    XLSForm is a form standard created to help simplify the authoring of forms using a spreadsheet program such as LibreOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel. They are simple to get started with but allow for the authoring of complex forms by someone familiar with the syntax.

    The plugin algorithm converts a XLSForm file into a QGIS project containing a survey layer with a feature form reflecting the authored form. This can facilitate the creation of complex feature forms through a simple, well-known format.

    An option to upload the generated project directly to QFieldCloud facilitates its deployment to QField, an open-source fieldwork app for geospatial data collection built on top of QGIS. A deployment through QFieldCloud enables multiple collaborators to seamlessly work on the same survey layer. This option works alongside the QFieldSync plugin.
